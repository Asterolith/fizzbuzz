# FizzBuzz

A classic FizzBuzz implementation written in Python, 
designed with clean code practices, modularity, and maintainability.

## Description

Print numbers from 1 to 100, with the following rules:

- If a number is **divisible by 3**, print `"Fizz"`
- If a number is **divisible by 5**, print `"Buzz"`
- If a number is **divisible by both 3 and 5**, print `"FizzBuzz"`
- Otherwise, print the number itself

The solution is easily adaptable to other ranges and rules.

## Example output

1
2
Fizz
4
